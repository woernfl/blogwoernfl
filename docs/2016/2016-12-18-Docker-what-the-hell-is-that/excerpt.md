What is Docker, this not so old technology that everybody is talking about but that nobody seems to really understand?

First of all, Docker is 2 things:

- it is a software container platform (Docker Engine) which is open-source and is under Apache 2.0 licences, so free to use and redistribute
- it is also a company, Docker Inc, which is the creator of the Docker Engine open-source project

Here, when we will speak about Docker, we will only speak about the open-source project, the Docker Engine.
